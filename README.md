### News App :
============

An application to show news headlines and details which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch the top headlines.

## Architecture
---------------

The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
